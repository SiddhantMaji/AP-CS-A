> ### Developing Understanding

> This unit introduces students to the Java programming language and the use of classes, providing students with a firm foundation of concepts that will be leveraged and built upon in all future units. Students will focus on writing the main method and will start to call preexisting methods to produce output. The use of preexisting methods for input is not prescribed in the course; however, input is a necessary part of any computer science course so teachers will need to determine how they will address this in their classrooms. Students will start to learn about three built-in data types and learn how to create variables, store values, and interact with those variables using basic operations. The ability to write expressions is essential to representing the variability of the real world in a program and will be used in all future units. Primitive data is one of two categories of variables covered in this course. The other category, reference data, will be covered in Unit 2.
